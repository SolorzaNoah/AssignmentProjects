Plug in the finch robot with the USB connection.
Make sure it is detected by the PC.
Go to the finchrobot website.
Since python is being used, download the package for python.
With the finch robot plugged in, run the example programs and the finch robot should respond.
(For some reason running them through command prompt didnt work, so I had to individually select them directly
from file explorer by double-clicking them)
