The people in the group are Rolando Negron, Noah Solorzano, and Johnathan Ninan. The program
we are running is a simple maze game, where you have to get from point A to point B. There are
boundaries in which a person who touches it will have to restart. The way to interact with it,
is through the mouse. To begin the game the player will have to hover above the text "start" 
and left click to begin the game. Each level you will have to maneuver your way to the exit,
where it will transition to the next level. There are three levels in total. And in the
end, you can press any key light up the box for being able to win.
