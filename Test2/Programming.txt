a)	 A filehandle is the name of the I/O connection between the perl script and external data. Data can be
         manipulated within the filehandle and it makes the scripting more efficient, as you can simply close 
	 the filehandle as soon as it is done being used. Perl can use filehandles to connect to almost anything.

b)	 Subroutines are lines of code that, instead of being re-written every time they are required, programmers
	 tie them into a single unit, that can be recalled with a simple command whenever needed. This makes the code
	 both cleaner and faster. Subroutines can be thought of variables that represent actual lines of code.

c)	 A perl module is a package that contains essential bits of code that programmers use often so they are gathered
	 up to be recalled later on instead of having to retype them every single time a programmer would like to use them.
	 These tools inside of the module are called subroutines, and can be defined by a simple name like “Number_Adder”
	 and perform actions when recalled in a new perl script that goes to the module, pulls the subroutine and uses it.
	 It is like a cheat sheet you can recall anytime you want.

d)	 Regular expressions (regex) is a mini-language within perl that uses strings to match patterns. The syntax uses  
	 single letters combined with symbols to perform matching tasks which include substitution and matching, being some 
	 of the most common. They are brief, but very powerful as they can really scan through an entire file to perform a match.
